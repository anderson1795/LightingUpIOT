Building A Phone App
====

Its time now to build a phone application. We are going to roughly be following the instructions that you find on [this site](https://ionicallyspeaking.com/2017/01/16/creating-a-beacon-application-with-ionic-2/). In our case we are going to be working on Cloud9 so I already did the setup but in case you need to start from scratch you will need the following:

1. Install node on your computer
2. Install ionic globally (`npm install -g ionic cordova`)
